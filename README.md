Developing Implementation of Ensemble Based Learning of Neural Networks for Novetly Detection (EBNN). 

# pytorch_practise.ipynb
In this file I have started learning pytorch and build a simple feed-forward neural ent to classify flowers in the iris dataset. I am starting to devleop the framework to adapt to the EBNN algorithm
